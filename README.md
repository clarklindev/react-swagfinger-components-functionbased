# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

#### test url

https://swagfinger-portfolio-react-components-functionbased.vercel.app/

---

#### Project JS

- functional components
- uses hooks
- styled-components
- simplified components (built by developer for developers)

#### CRA

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

- React 18
- new simplified redux using the ReduxToolkit

#### [styled components](https://styled-components.com/)

- has support for theming

#### [styled components modifiers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components-modifiers)

- has support for style modifiers

# React+ReduxToolkit

- https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started

## add to existing project

```console
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```

## install as CRA project template

```console
 <!-- Redux + Plain JS template -->

npx create-react-app my-app --template redux

 <!-- Redux + TypeScript template -->

npx create-react-app my-app --template redux-typescript
```

## redux toolkit APIs

- configureStore()
- createReducer()
- createAction()
- createSlice()
- createAsyncThunk()
- createEntityAdapter()
- createSelector()

## RTK Query

- an optional addon within the @reduxjs/toolkit package
- used for data fetching and caching - eliminating the need to hand-write data fetching & caching logic yourself.

```js
import { createApi } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query';

/* React-specific entry point that automatically generates
   hooks corresponding to the defined endpoints */
import { createApi } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react';
```

## Redux Fundamentals, Part 8: Modern Redux with Redux Toolkit

https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-8-modern-redux

## Typography

## Component properties

- using configure={} allows stabilizes the properties a component can take in and creates familiarity on structure
- 'configure' we place all properties/functions we want pass to the component in the configure object
- 'data' (can be from async call) should pass to data property.
- 'savedData' is data that we store for this component which is handled outside of the component in state

- links are for redirecting outside/url changes
- buttons are for navigating within site

## Roadmap

- multi-range slider - add mouseclick for track - closest slider moves to track position
  - optimize renders
  - colors for track from amount slided
- standardize (hover/active state) outline for all components
- checkbox intermediate state

## updates

2023-01-25

- seems available gap- values are: gap-1, gap-2, gap-4, gap-5, gap-10
- changed to use "gap-" syntax instead of 'className="gap-4"'

- added RadioButtonAndLabelSomethingExample
- added RadioButtonGroupAndLabelSomethingExample
- added CheckboxAndLabelSomethingExample
- added CheckboxGroupAndLabelSomethingExample

- accordion - [allowMultiOpen, setAllowMultiOpen] useState moved into Accordion
- accordion example - updated

- button - default top/bottom padding set to 10px
- button variation example - icons moved out and imported from icons/
- ButtonWithLabelSomethingExample - icons moved out and imported from icons/
  - Button removed className='gap-2'
  - LabelSomething removed className - added spacing=""
- button modifiers - large - tweaks

- Checkbox - wrapping container removed - label is the wrapping container

  - default: flex-direction row
  - can pass-in label
  - can pass-in iconSize
  - can pass-in color

- CheckboxAndLabelSomethingExample
- CheckboxGroup
  - can set direction: row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse
  - can set spacing - whatever units you want: px, rem
  - receives children
  - Checkbox moved outside component
- CheckboxGroupAndLabelSomethingExample
- CheckboxGroupExample
- LabelSomething

  - component allows you to place labels in top,left,right, bottom direction of "Something"
  - labelClickable
  - gap - can set the gap between the label and the something. eg. spacing={1} spacing={2} spacing={4} spacing={5} spacing={10}
  - can set align
    ROADMAP: want to adjust labelPosition to "direction" more aligned with RadioButtonGroup and CheckboxGroup

- RadioButton + RadioButtonGroup + all their examples align with checkbox (same implementation)
- Select - padding top and bottom adjust
- Themes - added global margin

  2023-01-19

- Input component - overhaul of whole component - separation of concerns (buttons / icons moved out of component)
- InputWrapper which is part of Input component - you use this when you want to hide the input style that this component wraps
- input examples
- Icons moved to its own component
- additional Button modifiers
- LabelSomething class - use this to label anything - WithLabel class removed
- Snackbar uses an icon component
- colors added
- themes with adjustments and additions
- Button - Button content/label can be received as children
- Theme tweak to padding 1rem , add select defaults
- chevron icon
- Select styling
- Relook margins on all inputs - 1rem
- relooked App demo page component margins

- Redo Checkbox icon using Icon class - note: its not a Button because Checkbox has its own event handler for event.target.checked
- Icons can be left as svgs (dont need to touch)
- Icon fill and stroke is set on the Icon class for when it is toggelled (see example)
- Align Light theme with Dark theme properties
- fixed cursor pointer for some components
- fixed up Radio Button - no icons in heroicons, made my own

## Roadmap

## Updates

- AccordionItem layout/padding and theme references
- Inputs - moved modifiers into its own file in same directory
  Composition of components:
  Input
  InputWithIcon -> Input
  InputSearch -> Input
  InputPassword -> InputWithIcon -> Input
- Icons inside components referenced as a variable instead of between Styled component tags as its children
- ToggleSwitch given ids with UID: import { useUID } from '../../utils/helpers/UseUID';
  - optimised with React.memo
  - React.memo check exclude onChange function what will cause this component to re-render as it always stays the same
- theme structure change (moved icons to its own section)

The outermost component should have the border.
Input components using other input components pass-in "noborder" and "noborderradius" or "noborderleftradius" or "noborderleftradius" modifier so the inner components dont have borders

you may get confused with what to change and where to change theme colors

1. first, code needs to link to an attribute of a theme
2. changes are only made to theme (which will ripple on to the code/components)
3. if you dont like colors in the theme, you only change the utils/colors (which will ripple on to the theme -> then to the code/components)

2023-01-15

- ToggleSwitch uses useUID() a custom hook in utils/helpers/UseUID to generate unique id classses so colors dont get overridden otherwise they are all using the same className and when color updates, they all update
- ToggleSwitch DOES NOT USE React.memo to optimize rerenders only when props change
- ToggleSwitch does not use React.useCallback to memoize onChange function as it is ignored in the React.memo() second prop function check
- theme structure change - added 'global' properties

  2023-01-15

- Hook - useUID() utils/helpers/UseUID
-

- fixed theme in App.js for dark mode (default) / default mode
- Accordion - rework to decouple Accordion children using render props
- Button
  - moved modifiers outside to its own file (easier to reference)
  - <Icon> children given size (not only to svg)
  - with icon - labelDirection
- Card - added dropshadow example (modifiers="dropshadow")
  - modifiers={Array.isArray(modifiers) ? [...modifiers] : modifiers}
- Input - styling reads from theme
  - child components imported inherit dimensions
- Radio - moved RadioGroup data outside of configure obj
  - data initialized inside useEffect()
- Snackbar - conform to jsx camelCase
- Typography - moved Header sizes into theme
- removed default Counter redux code
- themes moved to utils/themes
